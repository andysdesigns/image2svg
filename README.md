Python script converting an image to horizontal and vertical vectors, allowing it to be printed on an XY plotter.

Made during the development of an XY plotter firmware to test the limits and precision of the system (and for fun). 
It allowed me to notice a small drift caused by one of the motor driver torque, which I subsequently calibrated.
